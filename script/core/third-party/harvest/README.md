# Chosen

Chosen is a library for making long, unwieldy select boxes more user friendly.

- jQuery support: 1.4+

For documentation, usage, and examples, see:

### Fork Changes

I've forked this project to render Chosen dropdown with fixed position, allowing Chosen to be used inside areas with `overflow:hidden`. This problem is very common, as you can see on [Issue #86](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/issues/86), but fixing it is not so easy.

### Fork ToDo

* Teste it more, with different customization options.
* Prototype version. Only jQuery for now!
